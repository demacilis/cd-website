            1.1 What is the purpose of IT in modern business?</h>
        <p class="post-date">07.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            Information Technology plays immense role in modern business. It has become a vital and integral part of
            every business plan. From multi-national corporations to small businesses, IT is omnipresent. It is being
            used accross the business world in many different ways like: communication between employees, suppliers and
            customers (use of e-mail or Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephones and smart-phones), Inventory
            management systems (use of the POS system), data management systems (storing digital versions of documents
            on servers and storage devices), management information systems (enable companies to track sales data,
            expenses and productivity levels) or customer relationship management ((CRM) systems capture every
            interaction a company has with a customer).</p>
        <p>As shown above, we can agree that purpose of IT in modern business is to make it work better in any way,
            shape or form.

        <p class="post-date">07.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            Your needs to make your work successful will be different depending on the project/with every project. Some
            needs won’t change like being organised and focused. Another thing every project needs is a plan. Plans
            should typically be based on an aim, some specific objectives and/or targets. </p>
        <p>Skills like good communication
            are key as you might end up working in a team if it is a large project or even consulting and updating your
            client on the progress of your work. Your tools may vary depending on the project, if you’re writing a
            simple web application or a script using python, to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
            you will need a different language like CSS.

        <p class="post-date">07.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            Before making a plan I would do research on the market we’re approaching, customers we’re targeting and
            compare competition.</p><br>
        <p>If I was making a text-based game my plan would look like this:</p>
       <p><a href="https://trello.com/b/LILdqwGb/game" target="blank">Trello Board</a></p>
        <br>

        <p>My plan for making a website would look like this:

        <ul>
            <li>a task list - for every step of the website creation process
                a schedule - timeline for the completion of tasks, testing and launch</li>
            <li>a budget - to cover all stages of the project (i.e. planning, design and development costs, any
                functionality you might need, as well as annual hosting and support costs, marketing costs)</li>
        </ul>

            1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital
            projects
        </h>
        <p class="post-date">07.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            There is a lot of factors that might impact a digital project. Someone might leave the project earlier, the
            company might be merging with another company with different go-to-market strategy, might be a lack of
            skills, recources, employees, budget might be exceede, etc. We can categorize them like this:
        <ul>
            <li>Known/Known – We are aware of these during planning and understand what to do should they occur.</li>
            <li>Known/Unknown – We are aware of these during planning, but aren’t fully prepared to respond to them.
            </li>
            <li>Unknown/Known – We aren’t aware of these, but know how to handle them if they occur.</li>
            <li>Unknown/Unknown – We aren’t aware of these and don’t know how we would handle them.</li>
            <br>
            <p>For example Known/Known could be knowing that different browsers might display the content differently,
                so we have to make sure we’ll code it adequately.</p>

            <p>A different example might be when we know we might need to use databases (known) but we don’t know yet
                how to use them (unknown)</p>

        <p class="post-date">10.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            In order to select the right kind of technology for the job you need to determine what’s needed to complete
            the job. We can use a website as an example. We’re building an e-portfolio so we’re going to need: knowledge
            of HTML and CSS and some text editor to write our code in. We will also need a server and a domain later on.
            If we were building a chat bot we might be using different coding languages and scripts. If you’re working
            in team you might use tools like Trello to make the whole process organised and engaging for everybody.

        <p>
            We needed to have access to the same code we’re writing but we also needed everybody to have a code file of
            their own. Using repl.it and VSCode helped us to achieve that. Having trello board helped us plan the whole
            project, which was essential. We were considering GitHub before repl.it, but in our case GitHub turned out
            not to be very helpful.

        <p class="post-date">10.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            One principal aim of GDPR is to increase protection for individuals’ personal data. It impacts digital
            projects on many levels restricting the usage of personal data:</p><br>



        <p>Under GDPR, methods digital marketers use to obtain consent will be held to a much higher standard. Any
            marketing campaign using personal data procured in the past will need to meet them too. Any marketer using a
            tool such as Facebook Custom Audiences will need separate consent from the individual for their email
            address to be used for promoted social media posts.</p>

        <p>Under GDPR, it will be easier for individuals to withdraw their consent for data processing. Also, under
            GDPR individuals have a right to access any data you hold on them too. This includes when, how and to what
            they consented, plus the data you hold.</p>
        <p>Finally, digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really need, requiring legal
            justification for why the personal data they’ve collected is being processed.

        <p>I was using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for editing
            and writing my code. <a href="https://trello.com/b/6sAMFJyF/website-plan">Trello</a> was my go
            to for planning and organising the proccess. When I learned a little bit more about CSS I changed my approach, for example using CSS to centre something, or put it in certain place, rathen than using "< center >" HTML tags. I used one CSS class to make my "menu" which made the whole proccess easier and the code 'cleaner'. For consultation I was using <a href="https://zoom.us/">ZOOM</a>.

        <p>All the tools turned out to be appropriate. Visual Studio Code for running tests, reviewing code showing problems and highlighting potential wrong syntax etc. The whole proccess was pretty organic, but Trello helped organise it a little bit better. Doing research on certain CSS attributes allowed me to achieve desired outcome efficiently. Zoom was perfect
            for communication and consultation, where I could share screen or video in a conference call and take productive feedback on board at the time of recieving it.
            The tools I chose made my work easier.</p>

        <p>
            I am happy with my final project. I have never fully coded a website (or coded at all!) before, so my goal was to code a fully working website. In the proccess, certain things started to just work together (mostly thanks to CSS) and I added more stuff I wasn't even considering before. I think the strengths of this website are: colours, clarity, simplicity. I like how the colours match the theme (which has been used in the banner), simple 4-bar menu with changing its text and box colour.</p>
            <p>However, I think that amount of text on the blog might be a little bit overwhelming which is an obvious downside. I tried to keep it streamlined and formatted in an appealing way but it still might be a lot.</p>

        <p class="post-date">15.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            I would consider dividing the website into three columns, where the middle column would keep all the content and side columns would just be plain background. It's just an idea so the website doesn't appear so wide (even though I like it this way). Another improvement could be reviewing the text, maybe I could shorten it a little bit without losing the meaning or change the font to a smaller one. I feel like it could be a personal preference, so I would have to do some more research on this subject.

        <p>
            The requirement was to fully code a working website using HTML, CSS and other appropriate tools. Another requirement was to match the theme of the website with the theme "Dracula" for Visual Studio Code. The blog is intended to be about my journey at Code Nation so I wanted to implement some kind of reference to coding in the banner and general theme of the website.</p>
            <p>With main weakness being amount of text/formatting I consider website matching requirements, the website is fully working and running, visually pleasant and user friendly. The visual requirements exceeded my expectations because I was scared of CSS at the beginning but the more I worked with it the more I liked it.</p>

        <p><a href="slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> and <a href="zoom.us" targer="_blank">Zoom</a> was quite beneficial in getting feedback on my website.

        <p>
            You can improve productivity and efficiency in many ways. One of them would be using appropriate IT tools
            and systems. For example, if you’re working in the team and you can’t access github and you need to
            share/edit code together, you might consider repl.it which would make it possible. Also, if you’re working
            in team, consider an application allowing you to communicate “live” like ZOOM, discord. </p>
            <p>You can even improve your efficiency using keyboard shortcuts. In Visual Studio Code I was constantly using "format code"  and "save" shortcut. Saved login details in open tabs like "repl.it", "slack" saved us some time not having to log-in everytime we want to change the code. Having a channel on "Slack" where we could "pin" all the projects/links/important posts helped us organise work massively.

        <p>
            On my next project I will have github set up and I will use that instead of repl.it. The website is nice and
            useful but at the end of the day everybody needs to copy that code we wrote to their console/editor on their
            PCs. Slack and zoom will stay as they only improved our productivity and efficiency.

        <p>
            I would test digital solutions in various ways, looking for the best outcome giving the highest productivity
            and efficiency. Probably I would make a list/plan of tests I need to carry out.</p><p>For example, in a website I would be looking for bugs/errors (broken images etc.), I would check how the website
            I made is running on various devices, networks (3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi), browsers and operating systems to make
            sure it is being displayed the way it’s been designed. I would check the spelling, formatting etc. for any digital project.
