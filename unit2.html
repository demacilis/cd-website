            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities
            may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
        </h>
        <p class="post-date">19.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            Accessing the Web, most blind people rely on screen readers and/or refreshable braille displays. Barriers
            that people with blindness may encounter on the Web include:
            images that don’t have ‘alt’ text , complex images that are not adequately described, video that is not
            described in text or audio, tables that do not make sense when read serially (in a cell-by-cell mode),
            frames that do not have “NOFRAME” alternatives, or that do not have meaningful names. We can help them
            access the website by assigning a text to ‘alt’ attribute so a blind person’s screen reader can read it out
            to them), describing complex images or videos, giving frames “NOFRAME” alternatives etc.</p> 
            <p>To use the Web, color blind people may use their own style sheets to override the font and background color
            choices of the author. Color blind people may encounter problems using the web if i.e. text inadequately
            contrasts with background color or patterns, browsers they’re using do not support user override authors’
            style sheets.
        We can overcome it by allowing the user to override authors’ style sheets. </p>
            <p>Deaf people to use the Web may rely on captions for audio content. If there’s lack of captions or
            transcripts for audio content on the Web, they will have problems using it. Also they will struggle if
            there’s lack of visual signposts in pages full of text, which can slow comprehension for non-native readers
            of a written language. Similar rules apply to people with mild to moderate hearing impairment.</p>

        <p>In order to use the Web, people with disabilities affecting the hand or arms may use a specialized mouse, a
            keyboard with a layout of keys that matches their range of motion, a head-mouse, head-pointer etc. They may
            activate commands by using single keystrokes rather than the simultaneous keystrokes. These people may need
            more time when filling out interactive forms on Websites. They will have problems if: browsers and authoring
            tools don’t support serialized keystrokes for commands, forms can’t be tabbed through in a logical order or
            interactive forms with time-limited response options. To overcome those problems we have to make sure our
            website can be used properly in that person’s browser so she/he can use serialized keystrokes for commands,
            implement forms with no time limit etc. </p>
        <p>To use parts of the Web that are beginning to rely on voice recognition, someone with a speech disability
            needs to be able to use an alternate input mode such as text entered via a keyboard. The core for the
            website to allow a speech impaired person access the website easily is to give an alternative input mode if
            voice-based interaction is required.</p>

            1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
        </h>
        <p class="post-date">20.01.2020</p>
        <p>
            There’s countless amount of filetypes. For websites we focus on those supported by the browser but also
            those being lightweight, most efficient and reliable. We do it in order to make the experience of browsing
            our website user friendly, quick and stable.</p>

            <p>When using an image on your website you can use <strong>.JPG / .JPEG</strong> (Joint Photographic Experts Group file), or
            .PNG (Portable Network Graphics). Depending on the type of the image, you will use different format. If it’s
            significant artwork requiring a lot of details you will use .PNG (Lossless graphics format. It’s for images
            with a considerable amount of artwork, for which JPEG produced large artifacts even with minimal compression
            rates. PNG does not produce artifacts) or if it is general image for web you will use .JPG or JPEG. (It
            supports lossy compession and allows us to discard fine details but .JPEG also easily delivers a reduction
            of file weight by a factor of 10 with barely noticeable artifacts, compared to lossless compression).</p>
            <p>You can import simple animations <strong>.GIF</strong> (Graphics Interchange Format). It is constrained to 256 being its
            biggest limitation but it allows lightweight animation with universal support.</p>
            <p>If you’re importing large audio files, <strong>.MP3</strong> (MPEG Layer 3 sound file) format is preferred. It still has high
            bit rate and is “lighter” than FLAC {lossless compression} or WAV but still allowing the file to maintain
            its quality (FLAC, WAV etc. quality-wise still will be better but they’re bit size will be much, much
            higher).</p>
            <p>Google developed <strong>WEBP</strong> format with the aim to provide a single web-capable image format to deal with all the
            typical use cases. It supports lossless compression and unlike JPEG, it allows transparency and animations
            that may combine images coded with both lossless and lossy compression (In principle, it should serve as a
            replacement for JPEG, PNG, and GIF).</p><br><br>
            <p>Other filetypes for web:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>.CSS</strong> - Cascading StyleSheet. We can use this type files to style our websites </li>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> - HyperText Markup Language (how the website will look)</li>
            <li><strong>.MIDI</strong> (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) - sequenced music files made on keyboards</li>
            <li><strong>.DOC</strong> - Microsoft Word type file</li>
            <li>.<strong>AVI</strong> - Audio/Video Interleaved</li>
            <li><strong>.MPEG / .MPG </strong>- is an MPEG video file format</li>
        </ul>
